# The 1379 project
The 1379 project is a project for me to improve the project a little bit more and to show how much potential it has for others. To introduce a little about the 1379 project, 1 out of 1379 is 1 week, 3 is 30 days, 7 is 70 days, 9 is 90 days. So, for example, if I commit every day to 1 Github, I commit every day for a week and post what I did, and show the results and how much I have grown. If you are 9 and make an app, I think it will be possible to show how much perfection and concentration you have put into making an app for 90 days, show that other people can do it with the results, and how focused you can do it in a short period of time because there is a deadline. I made a project, and I plan to do it like this for a while.
